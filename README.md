# Assignment 3 
## Bouncing Balls

For this assignment you will:
* Design a world (big-bang) program that displays many bouncing balls, of different sizes, colors, and velocities.
* Follow the Design Recipe to develop functions that consume/produce an individual ball, and a list of balls. 

### Description

For this assignment, you will design a world (big-bang) program that moves many balls around the scene simultaneously, each one bouncing off all four walls of the scene. I've provided you with starter code and instructions that you should find helpful. Your balls should be different colors and sizes, and move with different velocities.

To get started, launch DrRacket and follow the instructions provided in the assign3.rkt to complete the assignment.

Be sure to follow the Design Recipe for each function you develop.
